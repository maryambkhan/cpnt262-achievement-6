- Yesterday when i was working in lab time i ran into an
  error it was becouse of `eslint`. I asked for help 
  and patrick helped me 
- Sloution was installing eslint 
  [eslint](https://eslint.vuejs.org/user-guide/#usage)
  for me this one worked:
     `npm install --save-dev eslint eslint-plugin-vue`
- So today i started new project and already installed eslint 
   i am hoping there is no problem.
- Plan:
  - Components:
    - TheHeader
    - TheNavBar
    - MainContent
    - TheFooter
