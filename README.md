### Code Journal

- Yesterday when i was working in lab time i ran into an
  error it was becouse of `eslint`. I asked for help 
  and patrick helped me 
- Sloution was installing eslint 
  [eslint](https://eslint.vuejs.org/user-guide/#usage)
  for me this one worked:
     `npm install --save-dev eslint eslint-plugin-vue`
- So today i started new project and already installed eslint 
   i am hoping there is no problem.
- Plan:
  - Components:
    - TheHeader
    - TheNavBar
    - PageContent
    - PageContentHeader
    - TheFooter
- It was so good working in vue and using v-bind v-for and slot
  it took me whole lot of time learn becouse i did not had enough 
  practice before but after i inderstood why and how we use these
  it was amazing.
- I watched class video and followed the documents it helped.
- I have got plan data right know on page will do some more page level styling
  and try to use this : `<img :src="cat.photo" :alt="cat.description" />`
- It was so much fun working today i saw what can do and what i need to to more
  and working team was a learning process too.
- I have added footer herosection image thats what i did in the morning too.
  i did everything in steps started with simple compnents and then render them on 
   html page and then applied props,slot and v-bind.
